    <richText>The &#x201C;Blog&#x201D; link in the navibar is absent from the Science page on purpose. My intent was to not have the science page and the blog directly linked.&#xD;&#xD;It is like a literal navigation throughout the entirety of my site. You have to travel back to the main hub to go to the other section.&#xD;&#xD;I will probably wind up posting a new science blog on the science page instead, like I said I was going to do, but haven&#x2019;t gotten around to doing yet. &#xD;&#xD;The two parts of the site are separate, but are linked by a lifelong bond regardless. They are siblings of the same birth yet perform vastly different purposes. If you do not like my decision here then too bad.&#xD;&#xD;&#x2026;&#xD;&#xD;Also yes the comment box seems to have become beheaded. I would assume it is a problem with the code for it; I dunno. I&#x2019;ll fix it somehow eventually.</richText>
