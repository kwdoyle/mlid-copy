    <richText>Recently I&#x2019;ve been having some ideas about plans for my site. Seeing as I&#x2019;m getting more involved with research at school and that I am even now in the beginning steps of starting my own experiment, I am going to make a whole new section to my site that will contain all the details of my scientific endeavors! Now I&#x2019;ll finally have something that can mostly stand alone by itself without needing to be updated all the time (not that I update this blog too often anyway). &#xD;&#xD;Expect these new &lt;i&gt;exciting &lt;/i&gt;changes to be occurring within the next few months, seeing as I am still lazy when it comes to messing around with this stuff and I am also not too sure how to properly set this up which means I will be needing some outside assistance from a very well-established computer-man.</richText>
