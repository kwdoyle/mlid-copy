    <richText>So yeah, I just finished watching a few old episodes of The Office, regarding Jim and Pam&#x2019;s relationship, and now I&#x2019;m doubting myself. Yet again. &#xD;I dunno&#x2026; maybe I&#x2019;m feeling this way because after watching it, I feel more like &#x201C;Shit. That could have been us,&#x201D; and I na&#xEF;vely feel that things could turn out that way, but, alas, it&#x2019;s not. Because this is real life.&#xD;I also have to take my current feelings into account. I&#x2019;m not really sure I even &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;that way anymore, seeing as how our relationship is included in the many &#x201C;horrible, flaming plane crash[es] [that happened] over the summer.&#x201D;&#xD;I should just move along; things may be looking up, after all. I have to accept the sad fact of what happened and be done with it.&#xD;&#xD;Let&#x2019;s just hope there&#x2019;s a lot more exciting things to happen here at school. Band&#x2019;s already looking to be enjoyable. My friend from high school (and by that, I mean that she&#x2019;s actually still &lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;high school) is in the band with me. That makes it even more enjoyable, seeing as I already know someone there. And as it turns out, she has &lt;a href="http://youarethemoon.tumblr.com/"&gt;a blog too!&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;The band director also &lt;b&gt;really &lt;/b&gt;reminds me of Mr. Peter Randazzo: my band director from high school. They&#x2019;re friends, so it makes sense that they have &lt;i&gt;similar characteristics.&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;&#xD;&#x2026;&#xD;&#xD;Y&#x2019;know, this blog is more like an &#x201C;online journal&#x201D; or sorts. I haven&#x2019;t been using it to write interesting things all that much, but just recently I discovered the hi-larious blog that is &lt;a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/"&gt;Hyperbole and a Half&lt;/a&gt;, since I&#x2019;m on a blog-linking spree. I feel like I&#x2019;ve been &lt;i&gt;inspired &lt;/i&gt;to write more often here after discovering it. She is definitely a good writer and her stories are oh so interesting. Too bad mine aren&#x2019;t oh so interesting.&#xD;&#xD;But who knows what kind of crazy adventures I&#x2019;ll have to write about in the future!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Update:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;Alright. Maybe I&#x2019;m not truly over all of This. &#x2026;I really shouldn&#x2019;t be left alone with my thoughts for too long; I start reevaluating everything over and over again.&#xD;Now I kind of feel &#x2026;alone&#x2026; and cold.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;i&gt;&#x201C;Four&#x2026; three&#x2026; two&#x2026; one, I&#x2019;m letting you go.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;If only it were that easy&#x2026;&#xD;&#xD;&#x2026;&#xD;&#xD;I am awfully sorry you must read about this constantly, but I can&#x2019;t stop writing about it because it BOTHERS ME SO MUCH. And this serves as my semi-hidden online vent-space. So &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/i/000/052/812/original/Deal_with_it_dog_gif.gif?1275684729"&gt;deal with it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;9/8/10 Update:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;I do find the irony in me telling &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;to deal with this, as I myself should be the one dealing with it.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
