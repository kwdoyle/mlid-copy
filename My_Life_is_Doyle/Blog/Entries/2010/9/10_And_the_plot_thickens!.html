                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">So yesterday, I was hanging out in my room getting kind of hungry when Marc (he is my roommate in case you did not know. Which you didn’t) waltz in. I seize this as an opportunity to go across the street and get some food. Once we arrive, we then stand on the burger line for ≈40 minutes until we obtain our food. There weren’t even that many people on the line to begin with; they were just REALLY SLOW. But I can empathize with them, seeing as I once held the same type of horrendous job. …But I digress. After I had gotten my food, I go over to the soda fountain, to no surprise, to get a drink. There was this one girl there getting her beverage before me, and I had reached for my 16 ounce paper cup when she and I started giggling due to the obvious lack of space we both had standing there. So after I had gotten my drink, I went to go pay for my meal. As it turns out, she is already right in front of me on line. She notices; giggles again, and then picks up a bag of Funyuns®. I was totally baffled; I love those things! Seeing that a girl would enjoy overly garlicky-oniony empowered snacks, I became intrigued. However, she then left the food-purchasing room to what I could only think was the dining area. After I purchased my food, I waited for Marc to finish his food related shenanigans and then we went to go sit down. Hoping she was still in here <span class="style_2">somewhere, </span>I perused the first area only to see that she wasn’t there. I was a tad bit defeated, but I had not given up hope yet! Sure enough, there she was in the back area: sitting by herself on one of those individual table type deals. Seeing as Marc was with me, and being the slightly socially awkward person I am: I did not sit with her. Instead, we sat down next to/across from the table she was at. I glanced over now and then to get a better look at her. She was indeed fairly attractive, and I was hoping she was looking at me too. Later on, I heard some beautiful sounds emanating from somewhere in the room. I then realize that she is in fact SINGING! Oh man, she sang too! She’s a music-type person! This all seemed too good to be true. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Sure enough, Marc and I finish eating first and leave. I glanced over to her as we were leaving, but she was not looking. I’m really not sure why I didn’t say anything to her at all: e.g., “oh man, you like Funyuns® too? That’s to crazy!” But, alas, I did not. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I’m going to refer to this girl as Mystery Girl from now on. I really do hope I’ll be able to find her again eventually. Sooner than later is preferred. I’ll have to get all of my friends to help me on this, using only the description of “she’s got brown hair, is about my height, likes Funyuns<span class="style_3">®</span> and sings” to find her. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
