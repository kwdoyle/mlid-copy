    <richText>In light of the Christmas Season, I figured I&#x2019;d apply somewhat of a Christmas-theme to the homepage. It isn&#x2019;t much, but it&#x2019;s the thought that counts. Compare it to the humble Christmas Scrooge and Tiny Tim (and others) had at their happy-love-each-other-fest at the end of &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol; &lt;/i&gt;it&#x2019;s pretty much the same.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Edit: &lt;/b&gt;Now it looks like I&#x2019;m staring up at the decorations. This was totally unintentional, but it makes it all the more&#x2026; festive&#x2026;?&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;So yes, with Christmas right around the corner, I, like everyone else, cannot wait for these next two grueling weeks to end. And, ironically, I&#x2019;m wishing these two weeks to fly by, when we&#x2019;re only spending two weeks on vacation. I&#x2019;m somewhat torn about wanting these next 336 hours to go by fast, when that&#x2019;s the same amount of time I&#x2019;ll be wanting to go slow once I&#x2019;m actually on vacation. Hmm&#x2026;&#xD;&#xD;Well anyway, seeing as it&#x2019;s 2 in the morning, I should sleep, seeing as I have a cavalcade of work to do later.&#xD;&#xD;Yaaaay!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;Edit (again):&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;Now there are STOCKINGS on the comment page. Oh man. So goddam festive it isn&#x2019;t even funny.</richText>
