    <richText>Things need to speed up. Happen faster. I feel like I&#x2019;m on the right track now; that lots of good things await &#x201C;right around the corner,&#x201D; so to speak, but they&#x2019;re not happening fast enough. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I&#x2019;m pretty content with everything at the moment, as well as the idea that there&#x2019;s a great deal of potential for the future. It just has to &lt;b&gt;happen already.&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;But anyway, expect another installment of Kevin Listens To coming up sometime in the near future; because, yes, I can now continue that exciting series seeing as music now correctly posts here!</richText>
