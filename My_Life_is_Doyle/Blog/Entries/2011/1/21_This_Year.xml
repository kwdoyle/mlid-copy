    <richText>This is a pretty good song. I actually never listened to it when I first got the album because it was part of a &lt;b&gt;FREE DOWNLOAD &lt;/b&gt;bundle that came with the CD. Another song came with it; it was a remix of Schizophrenia which deeply frightens me with how much it deviates from the ever-so catchy beat of the NormalVersion. But yes, I tried incorporating these songs into the main album on iTunes which decided to give me a HARD TIME ABOUT IT so I gave up and made them a separate off-shoot album deale-o, but having the same album appear twice in my library irked me after a while so I got rid of the scaryremix and put just this song at the end of the normal album. Wasn&#x2019;t that a nice little story? &#x2D9;s&#x1DD;&#x28E; :&#x279;&#x1DD;&#x28D;su&#x250;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;So anyway, I&#x2019;m trying out making the line-spacing a bit larger. Does it improve readability?!? (Y/N) *note: answer is the same as the previous &lt;i&gt;hidden answer.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edit: &lt;/b&gt;Apparently QuickTime audio files won&#x2019;t load correctly in Safari for some reason. No one in the world is able to deduce the reason (I&#x2019;m serious). And this only applies to &#x201C;recent&#x201D; things published (i.e., the last two songs to be published here won&#x2019;t load in Safari while the rest will. Yeah, idfk either). So if some things won&#x2019;t load, then I am quite sorry. &#x2026;Although the number of people who read this site and use Macs and Safari are pretty slim anyway. If you really, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;want to listen to some &#x201C;fresh beats,&#x201D; then go download &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/chrome"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and listen to them there. This is in no way a shameful plug for Google Chrome. Ricky would also be very proud of me, despite this not being a shameful plug like I previously stated.&#xD;</richText>
