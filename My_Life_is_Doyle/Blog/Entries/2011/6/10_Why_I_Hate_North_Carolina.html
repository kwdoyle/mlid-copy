                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">Hey guys, I’m back! It’s been, what, two months since I’ve posted something? I guess that’s what happens when you’re BUSY. Regardless, this is my finalized story of why I hate North Carolina. The real kicker is, though, is that I actually, in no way shape or form, hate this state. We were all having dinner one day in our lovely dining centre across the street where we somehow got onto the topic of me hating North Carolina. When I tried to inform everyone that I was joking, Nicole From School insisted I was lying (responding to me saying I was joking with a rather hefty “Bullshit!”) Thus, I had to come up with an enthralling story off the top of my head to explain why I (apparently) hate North Carolina. Here is that story:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    <span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">Many moons ago, back in the year 1997, I was awoken in the midst of the night to a slow, steady, rap-a-tap-tap on my front door. I had crept down the hallway to watch my father open up the door, and whom which was located behind the door was a slender Asian man sporting a small black bowler hat. His hair was quite greasy and it shone in the dark like the oncoming lights of the Midnight Ferry. He had a small pice of paper in his hands which he handed to my father all whilst whispering a peculiar phrase into his ear: &quot;strike when the Eagle Flies.&quot; I hadn't known of this phrase's meaning at the time, and as it turns out, nor would I ever, but I was to discover that I would soon be embarking on the Journey of a Lifetime.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">    My father had told me to scamper off to bed right after this scenario, which I did, being the good child I was. When I had woken in the morning, I went out to the Center Mezzanine of my home whereupon I discovered I was alone in the house! I was quite frightened at first, but then out of the corner of my eye, I had spotted a lone end table precariously placed in the corner of the room. This table had the only cascadement of light streaming upon itself. I had decided to go and inspect what this table might possibly have to offer me, and to my surprise what lay on its gleaming surface was a note–and not just any note–it was a note from my father. It stated that he had been taken away by Him, and that dear mother had sought refuge in The Mountains. I was quite distraught with worry, and so I desired to save my father. I had went outside into the pasture out back to clear my mind before my journey. Outside, a sight to behold awaited me. Crows: thousands of them–all congregating amongst a pile of straw and thistles. As I approached them, I noticed something gleaming beneath their ebony bodies: a small, black, lustrous orb containing the Childhood One Had Never Possessed. I felt a dubious power emitting from the object. Thinking it may be of use, I pocketed the item. I then made my way down The Road to the nearest railway car. I was not sure of its destination, but I somehow knew it would take me to where I need be.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">    The train ride felt like it lasted for weeks. I stowed away on a freight cart, whereupon I encountered a strange man who seemed very interested in the Orb I possessed. He said he wished he, too, could have had a childhood with Treehouses and the like. He also confirmed that this orb would serve a greater purpose and that I should strive with all my might to keep it safe. Afterwards, he then entrusted me with The Sword of Elders that he pulled from the pile of woodshavings in the side of the cart. “Only those worthy may wield this blade,” he stated. I had asked him if he wanted to accompany me on my journey, but he proclaimed that riding cross-country in the back of a freight train cart was his life’s mission. With his final words, and apparent fulfillment of his goal, he jumped out of the cart. The train was still moving at full speed, mind you, but when I looked out to see if he had been reduced to a bloody and disfigured corpse, I could not find him. I believe there was more than met the eye with that man. He may have possessed unseen powers that no one would have ever guessed.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">    After the train had stopped at a new, uncharted locale, I secretly scuffled out from the cart, to ensure I was unseen from any wayward railroad workers, and out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a suspiciously familiar man wearing the very same bowler hat as the original man at my doorstep that night! I unsheathed my sword and charged at him. Alas, he spotted me and absconded from my wrath. Crestfallen, I had sought refuge from the icy pangs of disappointment in the nearest Friendly’s</span><span style="line-height: 28px; " class="style_3">®</span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2"> Restaurant. I ordered myself up a nice frothy Egg Cream and sat down at the nearest table. After finishing my delightful beverage, I got up to leave. Outside of the Greatest Restaurant on Earth, I encountered this very strange lady. She had questioned why I looked so sad, so I told her my story and asked her if she had seen That Man. As it turned out, she had! She said he headed eastward to the coast. “The coast?” I inquired. “We’re near the ocean?” “Why yes, we are!” She stated. “We’re in </span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_4">North Carolina!</span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">” Shellshocked, I stumbled away from her to regather my thoughts. After doing so, I stopped by the nearest Motorized Scooter Store, which coincidently happened to be right next to the Friendly’s</span><span style="line-height: 28px; " class="style_3">®</span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2"> Restaurant, and “rented” a scooter. (I say “rented” because I, unknowingly at the time, would never get the chance to return it). After heading eastward for roughly one half of an hour, I started to notice something exceedingly unnerving: everyone who I passed was staring at me with this hollow, ghost-like stare. At the time, I took it as them finding the sight of a small child riding at Motorized Scooter down the street quite odd, and thus expressing the proper expression for it. How wrong I was… how wrong I was….<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">    After riding for God knows how many hours, I could finally see the coast manifesting itself on the horizon. As I road even closer, I saw him. I saw his little black, rounded, demonic hat. I raced down to him, sword at the ready, and impaled him in the chest. To my surprise, he started laughing—giggling, if you will. “You think you can defeat me with simple weapons? Hah!” He shouted. Aghast, I did not know what to do. To make matters worse, the Asian man in the bowler hat started to transmute into an atrocious, monstrous beast. “Just try to kill me now! Ahahahahah!!!” he boomed In a ear-splitting tone. “Consorts, attack!” And with that, thousands upon thousands of people came staggering over the dunes. Horrified, I came to the realization that these were the very same citizens of North Carolina that I had seen oddly starting at me beforehand. “I have hypnotized the entire populous of this glorious state that is my hometown and forced them to do my bidding! Solely your father had the knowledge to operate the device that carried out my endeavor. I had no choice but to use him to put my plan into motion.” “YOU MONSTER; HOW COULD YOU?” I yelled, unaware of the present irony in calling an actual monster a monster. In my bewilderment, I had tripped and dropped the Orb of a Childhood One Had Never Possessed. “W–what is </span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_5">THAT?!</span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">” The now-monster yelled. “It–its presence.. IT BURNS! I feel… I feel such scornful sorrow for a childhood I never had!” Just then, the hoard of zombie-esque people had grabbed me and began to pull at my face and clothes, seemingly attempting to pull me down to the Underworld, where I would never breathe the life of the world above again. Thinking quickly, I reached for the orb with all my might and, once I regained possession of it, I threw it into the beast’s wide-open maw. The monster jutted back suddenly, making all sorts of abhorrent sounds. He let out an enormous roar and subsequently started to ferociously deteriorate. Huge shafts of light began to emanate from his body, and then, just as suddenly as this man appeared at my door, he exploded in a magnificent display of light and sound.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">    Once the aftershock of this hellacious event subsided, I turned around to see the hoard of people still standing behind me. They all looked very confused as to their current whereabouts. It appeared they retained no recollection of what had happened to them, nor what they had just done. Before I could say anything, they all simply meandered away, presumably back to resume their lives as normally functioning citizens. I began to search the skyline for any fleeting attempt to find my father, when all of a sudden–*</span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_5">HABOUSH</span><span style="line-height: 43px; " class="style_2">*–a submarine submerged from the depths, and from within emerged my father! I was overcome with a powerful sense of jubilation upon finally seeing him. He explained to me that the Man with the Hat had placed him inside this sub after initiating his plan. Upon defeating him, the controls on the vessel were free from his enforcement, and consequently could resurface again. Same went for the mind-control device. Once he was annihilated, its effects wore off. Y’know, like in any other action story with an antagonist who uses equipment of a similar manner. After all the loose ends were addressed, we had both boarded the submarine. “Now, let’s go pick up your mother from The Mountains,” my father exuberantly stated. And with that, we submarined off into the sunset on our journey home.<br /></span></p>
