# I don't know anything really about a wilcox test but I think it's the correct test and also the p-value is less than 0.05 so I guess the results are still significant?
# According to www.r-tutor.com, "At .05 significance level, we conclude [â€¦] the data set [â€¦] are nonidentical populations."

# LOL never mind, wilcox is some non-parametric rank test called willcox signed rank which has nothing to do with what I was trying to test for here. I have so much knowledge now omg.
